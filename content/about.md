Welcome to the woRk togetheR Warsaw Group!
We are a community of R-Users in Warsaw who support each other in using R for research and business. 
Our focus is providing a space for intermediate users to learn from each other. We have monthly, 2-hour work sessions where people bring their computers to work on their own projects, and ask each other questions as needed. 
Let us know if youâ€™re interested!
