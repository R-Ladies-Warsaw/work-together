Welcome to the Davis R Users’ Group (D-RUG)! We are a community of R-Users at UC Davis who support each other in using R for science and research. Our focus is providing a space for beginning and intermediate users to learn from each other. We have weekly, 2-hour work sessions where people bring their computers to work on their own projects, and ask each other questions as needed. We have no TAs - just mutual support from folks working on/in R and related topics. A group of D-RUG coordinators help organize and schedule worksessions and presentations. We usually have a few presentations each quarter on a wide range of R topics, from methods, best practices, new packages, or simply for folks to get feedback on their projects. Let us know if you’re interested!
